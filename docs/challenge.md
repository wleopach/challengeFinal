# Model configuration

* In order to make the model.py to work I generated another python script to store some functions that are used to 
transform the data, the name is [`utils.py`](../challenge/utils.py).
* I also updated the [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt), [`requirements-dev.txt`](../requirements.txt) and
[`requirements-test.txt`](../requirements.txt),to more recent versions.
